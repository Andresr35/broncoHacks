<h3 align="center">Bronco Life</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Full Stack MERN social media site for Cal Poly Pomona students meant to bring the commuter life more together! Also meant to work in conjunction with Canvas API to
     centralize the multiple apps CPP has for students. This app helps our students rate professors, give their experience on classes, create study groups, and invite commuters to off-
    campus study options.

### Prerequisites

Installation of npm and node is required!
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free Database Key at MongoDB
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh

   ```
3. Install NPM packages on both the client and server folder

### Tech stack

This uses React in the front end, with an express and node backend. The database being used is a MongoDB database, being connected with Mongoose. Bcryptjs is also being used in conjunction with JWT tokens to provide authentication to users when they log in.

### Method

While two other students worked on the structure and code of the backend, one student worked on the design of the website using figma before continuing onto writing react and css
